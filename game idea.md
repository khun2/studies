# start:
- you  wake up in a whiteroom (__purgatory__)
- you finished your term -> you can go to heaven -> just go in the machine that checks if you've accepted your sins -> machine breaks ->  you get sent forwards as it breaks all the time
- you get sent in a room and the manager tells you to try and get out while they figure out the issue
- turns out you have not fully accepted your sins
- you have to get through all your sins within an hour or you get stuck in hell
- manager helps you as they dont want to get reprimanded
- manager voice: multi layered like testament
